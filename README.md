# ClimateWins: Machine Learning with Python
## **Advanced Climate Pattern Detection & Predictive Modeling**

**Project Overview**
This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning analysis of European climate data conducted as part of the ClimateWins initiative-- a CareerFoundry Course Project

The objective of this project is to leverage supervised and deep learning techniques to:
- Detect abnormal weather patterns across Europe
- Evaluate whether extreme weather events are increasing
- Forecast potential future climate conditions (25–50 years outlook)
- Support data-driven decision-making for long-term climate resilience

The project progresses from classical supervised learning models to advanced deep learning architectures, including CNN and RNN/LSTM networks.

# **Project Objectives**
- Analyze historical climate datasets across Europe
- Identify predictive relationships between weather variables
- Compare performance of multiple machine learning models
- Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning
- Translate analytical findings into strategic climate insights

# **Key Questions Addressed**
